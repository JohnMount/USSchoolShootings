This is not a fully vetted analysis.  I copied data from Wikipedia (sources given below) and took a quick look. Also it would be good to normalize by the US school population (or at least US school age population) instead of the total US population.  But the observed ratio (current rate about 4 times the 1950s through 1960s typical rate) is large enough that it is plausible the rate is with investigating further (i.e. it is probably not entirely due to un-modeled changes in population age or school attendance rates).  

Follow-ups would include confirming input data, confirming data conversion, and taking a closer look at the estimated population model.

The data does combine a number of different scenarios (accidents, adults, and others), includes colleges, and excludes other "non gun" events such as the [Bath School massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath_School_disaster).

In this analysis we are being conservative in using an inflated comparison rate (to
try to not over-emphasize increase). The inflation is due to including only years 
in the 1950s and 1960s that had a shooting event and also there is a large event 
in the interval even though large events were rare in that time-frame
(so we have not chosen an interval that avoids such).

Also notice the US general population death rate by firearms does not follow the strong
upward trend we are seeing in schools: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/186951/deaths-by-firearm-related-injuries-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1970/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/186951/deaths-by-firearm-related-injuries-in-the-us-by-gender-since-1970/).
